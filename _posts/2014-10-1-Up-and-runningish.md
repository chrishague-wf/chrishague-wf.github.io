As you can see I have a site stood up - a blog for now until I find a good use for it. Jekyll has been my friend sofar. 

If you're interested in replicating this I used this quick  [Tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) to get things going. Of course I'm using GitHub's [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to do all of my static hosting.
